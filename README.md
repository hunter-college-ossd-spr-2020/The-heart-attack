### Public Repository for group 4  

This project essentially is a derivation of an earlier project from part 2. Essentially, the add-on works as a music extension where one can upload their own music files and use the slider to fast-forward or slow down the music that is playing. There is also a button where one can shuffle or move on to the next song. This currently only works for two songs. A later algorithm can be implemented to switch randomly at more songs. 
 
 


To test the add-on on Firefox:
 
1. Type in about:debugging in the search bar.
2. Click “This Firefox” on the right portion of the website
3. Click Load Temporary Add-on…
4. Look for the manifest.js file and open it. 
5. In the search bar look up “mozilla.org” to test it.
